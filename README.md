       - `cancel_appointment(appointment_id)`: Cancels an existing appointment.

 5. User Interface
   - userlogin(): Main function to handle user login, registration, and exit.
   - user_menu(schedule): This function provides a menu for logged-in users to manage clients and appointments.

 6. Utility Functions
   - clear_screen(): Clears the console screen.
   - pause_and_clear(): Pauses for user input and then clears the screen.

### Usage Flow
1. User Login and Registration:
   - Users are greeted with a menu to log in, register, or exit.
   - On successful login, users are redirected to the main menu to manage clients and appointments.
   
2. Client and Appointment Management:
   - Add Client: Users can add new clients by providing client ID, name, and contact information.
   - Schedule Appointment: Users can schedule new appointments by specifying client ID, date, and time.
   - View Appointments: Users can view all scheduled appointments.
   - Update Appointment: Users can update existing appointments with new time or change the associated client.
   - Cancel Appointment: Users can cancel existing appointments.

3. Error Handling and User Experience:
   - All user inputs are wrapped in `try-except` blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
   - Screens are cleared after each operation to provide a clean user interface.
   - Users are prompted to press Enter to continue, ensuring they have time to read messages before the screen is cleared.

### Example Workflow
1. Start Application: User runs the application and sees the main menu.
2. Register/Login: User registers or logs in.
3. Main Menu: After login, user can choose to add a client, schedule an appointment, view, update, or cancel appointments.
4. Add Client: User adds a new client.
5. Schedule Appointment: User schedules an appointment for a client.
6. View Appointments: User views all scheduled appointments.
7. Update/Cancel Appointments: User updates or cancels appointments as needed.
8. Logout: User logs out and returns to the main menu.

### Summary
This project provides a structured and user-friendly approach to managing appointments, with clear separations between user authentication, client management, and appointment scheduling. The application ensures smooth operation with robust error handling and screen management.
